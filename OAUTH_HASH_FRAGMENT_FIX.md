# OAuth Hash Fragment Issue Fix

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED FROM SCREENSHOTS

Your Supabase and Google Cloud configurations are **CORRECT**. The issue is that Supabase OAuth often returns tokens in URL **hash fragments** (after `#`) rather than query parameters.

## EXAMPLE OF THE ISSUE

Instead of: `https://www.loveaihub.com/auth/callback?access_token=xyz&refresh_token=abc`
Supabase returns: `https://www.loveaihub.com/auth/callback#access_token=xyz&refresh_token=abc`

Server-side code cannot read hash fragments - they're only available to client-side JavaScript.

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

I've updated the OAuth callback to handle both:
1. Query parameters (traditional server-side flow)
2. Hash fragments (client-side implicit flow)

## ADDITIONAL CLIENT-SIDE FIX NEEDED

Since hash fragments aren't accessible server-side, I need to add client-side JavaScript to handle them.
