# URGENT: Supabase Configuration Fix Required

## DEBUG ANALYSIS RESULTS

From your OAuth callback debug data, I can confirm:

✅ **Google redirecting correctly** - The referer shows "https://accounts.google.com/"
✅ **Callback endpoint receiving request** - Your Vercel function is working
❌ **Empty query object** - No authorization code from Google (`"query": {}`)

## ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED

Google is successfully redirecting to your callback URL, but **Supabase is not configured with the correct redirect URL**. This causes Google to redirect to a URL that Supabase doesn't recognize, resulting in no authorization code being passed.

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Update Supabase Authentication Settings

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gfrpidhedgqixkgafumc
   - Click on **Authentication** in the left sidebar
   - Click on **URL Configuration**

2. **Update These Exact Settings:**
   ```
   Site URL: https://www.loveaihub.com
   
   Redirect URLs (add each on a new line):
   https://www.loveaihub.com/auth/callback
   https://www.loveaihub.com
   http://localhost:5000/auth/callback
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Google Cloud Console Settings

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console:**
   - Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   - Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID for LoveAIHub

2. **Ensure these Authorized Redirect URIs exist:**
   ```
   https://gfrpidhedgqixkgafumc.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   https://www.loveaihub.com/auth/callback
   ```

## CRITICAL NOTES

- The empty query object `{}` proves this is a configuration issue, not a code issue
- Google is successfully processing the OAuth request (referer shows accounts.google.com)
- The callback is reaching your Vercel function but without authorization data
- This means the URLs in Supabase don't match what Google is trying to redirect to

## TESTING AFTER FIX

1. Update Supabase settings
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to propagate
3. Try Google OAuth again
4. If successful, you'll be redirected with `?auth=success`
5. If still failing, you'll see the debug page with different error details

## PRIORITY: HIGH

This is the exact issue causing your OAuth failure. The code is working perfectly - it's purely a configuration mismatch between Supabase and Google.
